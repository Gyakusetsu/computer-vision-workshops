# Computer Vision Workshops with AWS

A set of examples for computer vision use cases on AWS (SageMaker, Ground Truth, Rekognition, etc).

These workshops are created for demonstration/education purposes only and are not official AWS samples: Check out the [AWS Samples GitHub](https://github.com/aws-samples) and [AWS Solutions page](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/) for official content.

## Contents

* [sm_processing](sm_processing): Parallelized batch video frame image extraction with SageMaker Processing
* [gt_object_det](gt_object_det): Object detection (bounding boxes) using SageMaker Ground Truth for image labelling, and exploring Rekognition and SageMaker for model fitting
* [mxnet_gluon_mnist](mxnet_gluon_mnist): Image classification on MNIST Digits hand-written numbers data set with MXNet GluonCV
* [tf_script_mode](tf_script_mode): TensorFlow model training and serving with SageMaker (also on MNIST Digits)
